Dedicated Virtual Warehouse:
    - Separated according to different workloads
Scaling Up:
    - For known patterns of high work load
    - Increasing the size of Virtual warehouse
    - More complex query
Scaling Out:
    - Dynamically for unknown patterns of work load
    - Using addition warehouses/Multi-Cluster warehouse
    - More Concurrent users/queries
    - If we use atleast Enterprise edition all warehouses should be multicluster
    - Minimum default should be 1
    - Maximum can be very high
Maximize Cache Usage:
    - Automatic caching can be maximized
    - Running the same query by a different user in the same warehouse would be cached and 
    subsequent query executions will come from the cache
Cluster Keys:
    - They are subsets of rows to locate the data in micro-plans
    - For large tables this improves the scan efficiency in our queries
    - Snowflake automatically maintains these cluster Keys
    - In general, Snowflake produces well-clustered tables
    - Cluster keys are not always ideal and can change over time and hence we 
    can manually customize these cluster keys
    - Clustering is not for all tables and is mainly for very large tables of 
    multiple terabytes can benefit
    - We need to cluster on columns that are used most frequently in WHERE-clause 
    (often date columns in event tables)
    - If you use filters on two columns then the table can also benefit from two cluster 
    keys
