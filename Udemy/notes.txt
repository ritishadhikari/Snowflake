Data Protection Lifecycle:
    - Current Data Storage
    - If database or table is accidentally dropped
    - If table is truncated or updated accidentally
    
Time travel enables accessing historical data:
    - Query deleted or updated data
    - Restore tables, schemas and databases that have been dropped
    - Create clones of tables, schemas and databases from previous state

Considerations:
    - Undrop fails if an object with the same name already exists
    - Ownership privileges are needed for an object to be restored
