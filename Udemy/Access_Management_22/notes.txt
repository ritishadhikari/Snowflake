Who can access and perform operations on objects in Snowflake
Two aspects of aspects controll are combined:
    - Discretionary Access Control (DAC):
        - Each object has an owner who can grant access to that object
    - Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
        - Access privileges are assigned to roles, which in turn assigned to users

Securable Objects Consists of:
    - Account:
        - User
        - Role
        - Database
            - Schema
                - Table
                - View
                - Stage
                - Integration
                - Other Account objects
        - Warehouse
        - Other Account Objects

Every object is owned by a single role (multiple users)

Owner (role) has all privileges per default

Public -> User Admin -> Security Admin -> Account Admin <- Sys Admin

User: People or systems
Role: Entity to which privileges are granted (role heirarchy)
Privilege: Level of access to an object (Select, Drop, Create, etc)
Securable Object: Objects to which privileges can be granted (Database, Table, Warehouse, etc)

Sysadmin and Security Admin are the top-level role in the system. It should be granted only to a 
limited number of users

Useradmin role is granted to securityadmin 

Can manage users and roles and can manage any object grant globally

Sysadmin role are for create warehouses and databases (and more objects) and recommended that
all custom roles are assigned`

Useradmin role is dedicated to user and role management only and can create user and roles

Public Role is automatically granted to every user and can create own objects like every other
role (available to every other user/role)
