Cloning a database or schema will clone all contained objects

Zero-Copy Cloning can be done for the following:
    - Database
    - Schema
    - Table
    - Stream
    - File Format
    - Sequence
    - Stage (Named Internal stages not cloned)
    - Task
    - Pipe (Only for external stages)

- Cloning refers to taking snaphots of the object from the cloud service providers
- Cloned object is independent from the original table
- Easy to copy all meta data and improved storage management
- Creating backups for development purposes
- Typically combined with time travel
- Cloning from specific point in time is possible

When we clone a schema all the child object privileges will be inherited

Privileges:
    - Table:
        - Select
    - Pipe
        - Owner
    - Stream
        - Owner
    - Task
        - Owner
    - All other objects
        - Usage

Swapping:
    - Development table into production table
    - Involves only metadata operations
