Materialized_Views:
    - We have a view that is queried frequently and that a long time to be processed it 
    can give a bad user experience and give more compute consumption
    - Solution is to create a materialized view to solve that problem

Don't use meterialized view if data changes are very frequent and that time consider
leveraging tasks(& streams) instead

Materialized view is only available for enterprise editions and mvs don't support either 
of UDFs, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT clause
