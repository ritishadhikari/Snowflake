Snowflake Architecture:
    - Storage:
        - Hybrid Columnar storage
        - Data is stored in Hybrid Columnar storage in Blobs S3, Az Blob Storage, etc
    - Query Processing:
        - Muscle of the system
        - Performs MMP (Massive Parallel Processing)
    - Cloud Services:
        - Brain of the system
        - Managing infrastructure, Access Control, Security, Optimizer, Metadata, etc

Warehouse Sizes:
    - XS : 1 Server
    - S : 2 Server
    - M : 4 Server
    - L : 8 Server
    - XL : 16 Server
    - 4 XL : 128 Server

Multi Clustering enables a smaler server to integrate with other smaller servers and function like
a bigger server during time of need 

Only Account Admin and Sys Admin roles can be used to create new Data Warehouses in Snowflake
