Snowflake Architecture:
    - Storage:
        - Hybrid Columnar storage
        - Data is stored in Hybrid Columnar storage in Blobs S3, Az Blob Storage, etc
    - Query Processing:
        - Muscle of the system
        - Performs MMP (Massive Parallel Processing)
    - Cloud Services:
        - Brain of the system
        - Managing infrastructure, Access Control, Security, Optimizer, Metadata, etc

Warehouse Sizes:
    - XS : 1 Server
    - S : 2 Server
    - M : 4 Server
    - L : 8 Server
    - XL : 16 Server
    - 4 XL : 128 Server

Multi Clustering enables a smaler server to integrate with other smaller servers and function like
a bigger server during time of need 

Only Account Admin and Sys Admin roles can be used to create new Data Warehouses in Snowflake

SQL Command to create a warehouse through SQL:
'''
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE
    second_warehouse
WITH 
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE=XSMALL
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT=1
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT=3
    SCALING_POLICY="Economy"  -- Default is "Standard"
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED=TRUE
    AUTO_SUSPEND=300
    AUTO_RESUME=TRUE
    COMMENT="This is our second warehouse";
'''
Ensure the role selected from the drop-down to be either Sysadmin or Accountadmin 

SQL Command to Alter an already created warehouse through SQL
'''
ALTER WAREHOUSE second_warehouse RESUME;  -- the state will be resumed from auto suspended
'''

'''
ALTER WAREHOUSE second_warehouse
SET
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE="SMALL";  -- alter the warehouse size
'''

SQL Command to drop an existing warehouse
'''
DROP WAREHOUSE second_warehouse;
'''

Standard scaling policy favours additional warehouses while economy scaling policy 
favours conserving credits rather than starting additional warehouses

After creating a new database, we needs to define privileges. Privileges contains roles
and Privileges and describes for a certain role, which are the priviledges which are allowed
like Create Schemas, etc.

SQL command to create a table in a database and then add data to the table.
```
ALTER DATABASE 
    FIRST_DB 
RENAME TO
    OUR_FIRST_DB;

CREATE TABLE "OUR_FIRST_DB"."PUBLIC"."LOAN_PAYMENT" (
    "Loan_ID" STRING,
    "Loan_status" STRING,
    "Principal" STRING,
    "terms" STRING,
    "effective date" STRING,
    "due_date" STRING,
    "paid_off_time" STRING,
    "past_due_days" STRING,
    "age" STRING, 
    "education" STRING,
    "gender" STRING
);

SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    "OUR_FIRST_DB"."PUBLIC"."LOAN_PAYMENT";

COPY INTO 
    LOAN_PAYMENT
FROM
    s3://bucketsnowflakes3/Loan_payments_data.csv
file_format=(
    type=csv,
    field_delimiter=",",
    skip_header=1
);

SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    "OUR_FIRST_DB"."PUBLIC"."LOAN_PAYMENT";
